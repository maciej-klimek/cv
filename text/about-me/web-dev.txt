Hi! I’m Maciej Klimek, third year student of ICT at AGH University of Science and Technology. 
I’m currently seeking my first commercial experience in the form of an internship or part-time job. 
I am particularly interested in web development, networking, areas that I am
passionate about and eager to utilize in my work. I also possess skills in graphic design and UI/UX
design.
